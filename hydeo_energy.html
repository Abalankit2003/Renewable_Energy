[2]  Keywords Hydroelectric, Renewable Energy, Hydropower  1. Introduction Hydropower  is  electricity  generated  using  the  energy  of moving  water.  Rain  or  melted  snow,  usually  originating  in hills and mountains, create streams and rivers that eventually run to the ocean. This energy has been exploited for centuries. Farmers since the  ancient  Greeks have used  water  wheels to grind wheat  into flour.  Placed in a river, a water  wheel picks up  flowing  water in  buckets  located  around the  wheel.  The kinetic  energy  of  the  flowing  river  turns  the  wheel  and  is converted  into  mechanical  energy  that  runs  the  mill.  In the late  19th  century,  hydropower  became  a  source  for generating electricity. The first hydroelectric power plant was built  at  Niagara Falls  in  1879. In  1881,  street lamps  in  the city of Niagara Falls  were  powered by hydropower. In 1882 the world’s first hydroelectric power plant began operating in the  United  States  in  Appleton;  Wisconsin.  A  typical  hydro plant is a system  with three parts: an electric plant  where the electricity is produced; a dam that can be opened or closed to control water flow; and a reservoir where water can be stored. The  water  behind  the  dam  flows  through  an  intake  and pushes against blades in a turbine, causing them to  turn. The turbine  spins a generator  to  produce  electricity. The amount of  electricity  that  can be generated  depends  on how far the water drops  and how  much water moves through the system. The electricity can  be transported over  long-distance electric lines  to  homes,  factories,  and  businesses.  Hydroelectric power  provides  almost  one-fifth  of  the  world's  electricity. China, Canada, Brazil, the United States, and Russia were the five  largest  producers  of  hydropower  in  2004.  One  of  the world's  largest  hydro  plants  is  at  Three  Gorges  on  China's Yangtze River. The reservoir  for this facility started filling in 2003,  but  the  plant  is  not  expected  to  be  fully  operational until  2009.  The  dam  is 1.4  miles (2.3 kilometers)  wide  and 18  Askari Mohammad Bagher et al.:  Hydroelectric Energy Advantages and Disadvantages    607 feet (185 meters) high.  Hydropower is the cheapest way to  generate electricity today. That's  because  once  a  dam  has been  built  and  the  equipment  installed,  the  energy  source—flowing  water  is  free.  It's  a  clean  fuel  source  that  is renewable  yearly  by snow and  rainfall.  Hydropower is also readily  available;  engineers  can  control  the  flow  of  water through  the  turbines  to  produce  electricity  on  demand.  In addition, reservoirs may offer recreational opportunities, such as swimming and boating. But damming rivers may destroy or  disrupt  wildlife  and  other  natural  resources.  Some  fish, like salmon,  may be prevented  from  swimming  upstream  to spawn. Technologies like fish ladders help salmon go up over dams and enter upstream spawning areas, but the presence of hydroelectric dams changes their migration patterns and hurts fish  populations.  Hydropower  plants  can  also  cause  low dissolved  oxygen  levels  in  the  water,  which  is  harmful  to river habitats. </p>

    <p>2. Advantage of Hydroelectricity  1. Once a dam is  constructed,  electricity  can  be  produced at a constant rate. 2. If electricity is not needed, the  sluice gates can be shut, stopping  electricity generation.  The  water  can  be saved  for use another time when electricity demand is high. 3.  Dams  are  designed  to  last  many  decades  and  so  can contribute  to  the  generation  of  electricity  for  many  years  / decades. 4.  The  lake  that  forms  behind  the  dam  can  be  used  for water  sports  and  leisure  /  pleasure  activities.  Often  large dams become tourist attractions in their own right. 5. The lake's water can be used for irrigation purposes. 6. The buildup  of water in the lake  means that energy can be stored until needed, when the water is released to produce electricity. 7.  When  in use,  electricity  produced  by  dam  systems  do not  produce  green  house  gases.  They  do  not  pollute  the atmosphere. 8.  Renewable:  Hydroelectric  energy  is  renewable.  This means  that  we  cannot  use  up.  However,  there  are  only  a limited  number  of  suitable  reservoirs  where  hydroelectric power  plants  can  be  built and  even  less places  where  such projects are profitable. 9-  Green:  Generating  electricity  with hydro  energy is  not polluting  itself.  The  only  pollution  occurs  during  the construction of these massive power plants. 10-  Reliable:  Hydroelectricity  is  very  reliable  energy. There  are  very  little  fluctuations  in  terms  of  the  electric power that  is being by the plants, unless a  different output  is desired.  Countries that  have  large resources  of hydropower use hydroelectricity as a base load energy source. As long as there is water in the magazines electricity can be generated. 11-  Flexible:  As  previously  mentioned,  adjusting  water flow and output  of  electricity is easy.  At times where power consumption is low, water  flow is  reduced and the  magazine levels  are  being  conserved  for  times  when  the  power consumption is high. 12-  Safe:  Compared  to  among  others  fossil  fuels  and nuclear  energy,  hydroelectricity  is  much  safer.  There  is  no fuel involved (other than water that is).  Hydropower  is  clean.  It  prevents  the  burning  of  22 billion  gallons  of oil  or  120 million  tons  of  coal each year.  Hydropower  does  not  produce  greenhouse  gasses  or other air pollution.  Hydropower leaves behind no waste.[4]  Reservoirs  formed  by  hydropower  projects  in Wisconsin  have  expanded  water-based  recreation resources,  and  they  support  diverse,  healthy,  and productive  fisheries.  In  fact, catch  rates  for  game  fish like  walleye  and  smallmouth  bass  are  substantially higher on hydropower reservoirs than natural lakes.[5] Hydropower is the leading source of renewable energy. It provides  more  than  97%  of  all  electricity  generated  by renewable sources. Other sources including solar, geothermal, wind  and  biomass  account  for  less  than  3%  of  renewable electricity production [4]  Reservoirs formed by hydroelectric dams provide many water-based recreational opportunities including fishing, water sports, boating, and water fowl hunting.  Hydro  operators  own  a  significant  amount  of  land around  many  reservoirs  that  is  open  to  the  public  for uses  including  hiking,  hunting,  snowmobiling,  and skiing.  Hydro  operators  provide  many  recreation  facilities  at their  hydropower  projects  including  boat  landings, swimming  beaches,  restrooms,  picnic  areas,  fishing piers,  hiking  and  nature  trails,  canoe  portages,  and parking facilities.[5]  Hydropower reservoirs contribute to local economies. A study  of  one  medium-sized  hydropower  project  in Wisconsin  showed  that  the  recreational  value  to residents and  visitors exceeded $6.5  million annually.[6] Hydroelectricity  does  not "use"  water,  all  of  the  water  is returned  to  its  source  of  origin.  Hydroelectric  power  can  be created 24/7 indefinitely assuming that the body of water it is utilizing  never  runs  dry.  It  is  also  another  absolutely  clean source  of  energy.  The  power  plants,  once  in  place,  do  not create  any  waste  byproducts  in  their  conversion.  Dams constructed can also shut their gates and  conserve  the  water for use when power is in higher demand.</p>

    <p>3. Disadvantages of Hydroelectricity 1.  Dams  are  extremely  expensive  to  build  and  must  be built to a very high standard. 2. The high cost of dam construction means that they must operate for many decades to become profitable. 3.  The  flooding  of  large  areas  of  land  means  that  the natural environment is destroyed. 4. People living in villages and towns that are in the valley to be flooded, must move out. This means that they lose their farms and businesses.  In some countries, people are forcibly removed so that hydro-power schemes can go ahead. 
        American Journal of Energy Science 2015; 2(2): 17-20   19  5. The building of large dams can cause serious geological damage. For example, the building of the Hoover Dam in the USA triggered a number  of  earth  quakes  and  has  depressed the earth’s surface at its location. 6. Although  modern planning and design of dams is good, in  the  past old  dams  have  been known  to  be  breached (the dam gives under the weight of water in the lake). This has led to deaths and flooding. 7.  Dams  built  blocking  the  progress  of  a  river  in  one country  usually  means  that the  water supply from  the  same river in the following country is out of their control. This can lead to serious problems between neighboring countries. 8. Building a large dam alters the natural water table level. For  example,  the  building  of  the Aswan  Dam  in  Egypt has altered the level  of the water  table. This is  slowly leading to damage  of  many  of  its  ancient  monuments  as  salts  and destructive  minerals  are  deposited  in  the  stone  work  from ‘rising damp’ caused by the changing water table level.[7] 9-  Environmental  Consequences:  The  environmental consequences  of  hydropower  are  related  to  interventions  in nature due to damming of water, changed water flow and the construction of roads and power lines. Hydroelectric  power plants  may  affect  fish  is  a complex interaction between numerous physical and biological factors. More  user  interests  related  to  exploitation  of  fish  species, which  helps  that  this  is  a  field  that  many  have  strong opinions on. Fish habitats are  shaped  by physical factors  such  as water level,  water  velocity  and  shelter  opportunities and  access to food.  Draining  would  be  completely  devastating  to  the  fish. Beyond this, the  amount  of water may  have  different effects on the  fish in  a river, depending on  the type and stage of the lifecycle.  Not  all  unregulated  river  systems  are  optimal  in terms of fish production, because of large fluctuations in flow. 10-  Expensive:  Building  power  plants  in  general  is expensive.  Hydroelectric  power  plants  are  not an exception to this. On the other hand, these plants do not require a lot of workers and maintenance costs are usually low. 11- Droughts:  Electricity  generation and energy  prices are directly  related  to  how  much  water  is available.  A  drought could potentially affect this. 12- Limited Reservoirs: We have already started  using  up suitable reservoirs  for  hydroelectric  power  plants.  There  are currently  about  30  major  power  plants  that are  expected  to generate more than  2.000 MW under  construction. Only one of these projects was started in the last two years. [8] Like  all  power  plants,  hydroelectric  plants  are  very expensive to build, and must be built to a very high standard. The high cost means that plants  must operate for a long time to  become  profitable. The  creation  of dams  can  also create flooding  of  land,  which means natural environment  and  the natural  habitat  of  animals,  and  even  people,  may  be destroyed. The building of dams for hydroelectric power can also cause a lot  of  water  access problems. The creation of a dam  in  one  location  may  mean  that  those  down  river  no longer  have  control  of  water  flow.  This  can  create controversy  in  places  where  neighboring  countries  share  a water supply. The most common type  of hydroelectric  power plant uses a dam  on a  river to store water in a reservoir. Water released from the reservoir flows through a turbine, spinning it, which in  turn  activates  a  generator  to  produce  electricity.  But hydroelectric  power  doesn't  necessarily  require  a  large dam. Some  hydroelectric  power  plants  just  use  a  small  canal  to channel the river water through a turbine. Another  type  of  hydroelectric  power  plant  -  called  a pumped  storage  plant  -  can  even  store  power.  The  power  is sent  from  a  power  grid  into  the  electric  generators.  The generators then spin the turbines backward, which causes the turbines to pump  water from a  river or lower reservoir  to an upper reservoir, where the power is  stored. To use the power, the water is released from the upper reservoir back down into the river or lower reservoir. This spins the  turbines  forward, activating the generators to produce electricity.</p>
